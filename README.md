# Alexa, Pizza Please!
Hackcation

API aid from Pizzapi Dominos Porting project (Ported Classes of Node.js Module to Python)

In order to run you will need to install the Alexa Pizza Skills app to your Amazon Alexa Device. The Skill has been submitted for review and I will try to update if it gets Published for download. Besides that you can simply clone the repository and run the Python Main file. Make sure to change Localhost to whatever your default host is. Also your Echo must be connected to the same Network. The main python file currently supports testing and does not actually make a real order (in order to avoid 20 pizzas ordered while debugging and testing. To enable real ordering change the place_order method to deliver(order, payment) which should work. This way your amazon echo can communicate with the Python Code. Simply Run the script and order on your Amazon Echo. The script's json functions will automatically retreive JSON string when a post request is issued (Check Docs). Let me know if you run into Any Trouble!
